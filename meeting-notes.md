## Meeting Notes

- Attendee interests and background

  * Here to learn

  * From EHR development and background

  * Genie folks here to support JuliaHealth endeavors

  * Genomics research and prevention

  * Quebec Heart and Lung Institute

  * Representing PumasAI 

  * Consulting group

    + Developing health research in Michigan area

    + Aggregating claims data

    + To learn what is going on in the community

  * Creator of [MetaAnalysis.jl](https://github.com/arinbasu/MetaAnalysis.jl)

  * Involved with backend of healthcare IT

      + Have own secure system 

      + Post-COVID syndrome 

    + Computational biology 

      + Sickle Cell 

      + Applying some ML

* Problems within the Julia ecosystem

  + Julia needs more database connectivity to more easily do operations research

  + Databases are a pain point and composing with other aspects of the ecosystem

  + Interoperability within Julia and other sorts of resources

  + I end up doing the bare minimum in SQL

    + Do we have RAM?

    + Can we pull this into the Julia ecosystem?

    + Crank up the RAM! But only so much scaling

    + Minimal SQL writing

      + Searchlight.jl: Julia ORM layer within 

    + Is Genie like a shiny?

      + No, more of a full-stack

      + Goes beyond just visualization dashboards

  + Sequencing data

    + Equally data 

    + Everyone uploads data in slightly different ways

    + Make simple ways to pull that data

    + R Conductor --> JuliaConductor? 

      + Would make genomic pipelines within Julia pipelines a lot easier

    + We need to understand the underlying structures

    + One of the big pain points

      + Often to have roll your own

  + EpiR --> EpiJ?

    + Power calculators

  + Co-founder of start-up

    + Found unmet need for remote monitoring for neuotropenia

    + Non-invasive screen for neutropenia

    + Device runs Julia 

    + Pain points:

      + Testability of hardware

      + LOTS of CI -- bit of a pain

      + How much repetition happens in CI

    + Part of the problem for these problems:

      + There are still going to be folks who use the same organizations

      + Overcoming inertia to do the same or similar things in Julia

      + Wrapping around Julia? 

        + Bringing it into the R ecosystem

        + Leading to big impacts for callable things from R by having smaller static binaries

        + Wrapping Julia packages in R

      + N3C -- National COVID Cohort Collaborative

        + Went to many healthcare systems across the US to get COVID data

        + Shelled out to Palantir

        + Open source tools within the ecosystem

        + JuliaHub has Boeing board member

          + Trusted within security community

          + Could help in this situation

- Thoughts on how to address some of these problems

  * Using other packages outside of Julia

    + If you have some way to wrap around it

    + Getting support 

    + PythonCall.jl or RCall.jl

      + Not clear how to make this compositional

  * The paradox of compositionality

    + Blog posts go a huge ways to solving problems

    + Tutorials showing how things can be combined together

    + Promotional type material

    + Nice docs are *nice* 

  * The Julia Blog itself

    + Mentions JuliaBloggers but doesn't help with guiding users to read

    + Blogs need to go on as official blogs

    + Julia Forem -- is it maintained?

      + Hook into the tags from blogs

      + Cross-posting where appropriate

  * How to learn Julia within the context of health 

    + Carpentries for learning resources
